# Movie Search App Prototype

This is a basic prototype of a movie search web application built with React.js. It demonstrates the ability to fetch movie data from the TMDB API and display it in a simple, responsive user interface.

## Features

- Search for movies by title
- Display popular movies on the homepage
- View movie details including plot summary, genre, and ratings
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Setup and Running the App

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-app.git
   cd movie-search-app
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   
   

3. Start the development server:
   
   npm run dev
   

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the app.

## Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command:


npm test


## Technical Considerations

- Built with React.js
- Uses useState for state management
- Styled with sCSS
- Fetches data from the OMDB API

## Future Improvements

- Improve error handling and loading states
- Enhance the UI/UX design

## Note

This is a prototype and may not include all error handling or optimizations that would be present in a production application. The emphasis is on demonstrating the ability to work with React.js and API integration to build a simple web application.
